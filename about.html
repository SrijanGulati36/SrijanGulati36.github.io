           <h1>On a way to transform my life</h1>
           <p> Hi, I am Srijan Gulati. I belong to Delhi. I have been living here for past 21 years now. I stay here with my family. Besides my parents, there is a younger brother in my family. Currently, I am exploring myself as I am currently pursuing CSE from GGSIPU.

          I am very interested in programming. That was the reason I chose to pursue studies in Computer Science.   Not only am I passionate about the field I'm currently in, I am also inclined towards creative activities such as dancing, painting, acting, etc. I have always been an active student in school. I have participated in many cultural events during my school  days and have won many awards.

          In my free time, I enjoy going out with friends and trying new cuisines. I also enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading, working out, and going on road trips.</p>
